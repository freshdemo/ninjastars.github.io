<p>
Getting infrastructure deployed and configured correctly has been one of the most time consuming things when demonstrating the cybersecurity attack chain.
</p>

<h3>Option 1 - Build a Docker Container</h3>

<p>
The primary goal was to deploy this in a Docker container. Reason being it is infrstructure that is not needed all the time, and may need to move from a laptop, to Google Cloud Platform, to Azure, etc.

</p>

<h3>Option 2 - Build Your Own</h3>

<p>
You can easily interpret the Dockerfile to deploy all of the software and configurations manually on a host.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Option 3 - Run the Built Container</h3>

<p>
From a security perspective it is not a great idea to use an already built container as you have no idea how it was built or if any backdoor or data exfiltration configurations are pre-built. This container is automatically being built on Docker Hub any time a commit is made to GitHub, so what you see is what you get.

<code>
   docker pull freshdemo/mailanddns<br>
   docker run -h example.com -p 2225:25 -p 993:993 -p 53:53/udp --dns 127.0.0.1 -d <image ID>
</code>
